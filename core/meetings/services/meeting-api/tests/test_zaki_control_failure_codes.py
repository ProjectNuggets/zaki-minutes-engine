"""A failed capture must record WHY it failed, not the generic `internal_failure`.

Measured on 2026-08-14 from the live control-plane DB: 9 failed captures on staging + 2 on prod,
a ~28% capture failure rate in two independent environments, and EVERY one of them carrying
`failure_code = 'internal_failure'`.  The per-meeting bot pods are deleted after each run and
neither cluster aggregates logs, so those failures were undiagnosable — the row was the only
surviving evidence and it said nothing.

The cause was a dead translation, not a missing one.  The engine derives real attribution
server-side and persists it in `meetings.data` (`completion_reason`, `failure_stage`,
`spawn_failure_reason`), but the control layer read only `failure_stage` — whose vocabulary
(`joining`, `awaiting_admission`, `active`, `runtime_spawn`) shares NO value with the sealed
`FailureCode` enum.  So `_emit_capture_status`'s "not a known code" floor caught 100% of failures
and stamped `internal_failure` on all of them.

These tests drive the production `ControlCallbackDispatcher` over the in-memory store and assert
the specific code for each failure class the issue asks to distinguish.
