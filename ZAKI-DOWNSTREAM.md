# ZAKI Minutes downstream

This repository is the meeting-capture engine for ZAKI. It is an Apache-2.0 downstream of
[Vexa](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa), preserving upstream history and architecture while adding
the narrow ZAKI product boundary: visible meeting capture, tenant-scoped transcript storage, a
read-only agent surface, retention/erasure, and hub-controlled metering.

## Baseline and status

- GitHub fork: <https://github.com/ProjectNuggets/zaki-minutes-engine>
- Upstream remote: <https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa>
- Baseline tag: `v0.12.2`
- Baseline commit: `034ad78b718b9338182fd80288547419b44337b3`
- License: Apache-2.0; upstream notices and history remain intact.
- Activation: **ZAKI operates a deployment of this engine.** Meetings captured through it produce
  real meeting data — recordings, transcripts and derived summaries — which is held under the
  retention and erasure policy published in
  [README.md](README.md#zaki-minutes-retention-and-agent-read-limits). The topology of that
  deployment (clusters, hostnames, storage locations, credentials) is deliberately not published
  here.
- Current objective: complete the remaining Minutes read, retention, erasure and launch-acceptance
  work, with each feature default-off until its own gates pass.

> **Correction, 2026-08-14.** The activation line above previously read *"Activation: off. No ZAKI
> chart, secret, DNS, database, object store, or cluster resource exists."* That was accurate when
> this fork was created on 2026-07-13. It stopped being accurate when ZAKI's deployment went live
> on 2026-07-28, and was not updated at the time — so from that date until this correction, this
> public repository understated data collection. The README's "not activated in any ZAKI
> environment" notice carried the same error over the same period and is corrected with it.
> Corrected forward rather than by rewriting history.

### Which of this engine's capture features ZAKI has actually switched on

"ZAKI operates a deployment of this engine" says that capture is live. It does not say *how* ZAKI's
users capture a meeting, and the difference is large enough that stating only the former overstates
what a ZAKI user gets. This engine ships more than ZAKI has enabled; each operator chooses, and this
is ZAKI's choice as measured in its own production deployment on 2026-08-17.

| capability this engine ships | ZAKI production |
|---|---|
| Calendar sync (`PUT /user/calendar`, ICS import) | **off** — no calendar configuration is present |
| Auto-join sweep (the bot joins a `scheduled` meeting on its own) | **off** — reachable only via calendar/scheduled meetings, which are off |
| Manual capture request (a user pastes a meeting link) | **on — and it is the only way to start a capture** |
| Google Meet | on |
| Microsoft Teams | **off in production** (enabled in a pre-production environment only) |
| Zoom, Jitsi | off |
| Authenticated-bot mode (`BOT_AUTHENTICATED` + a stored browser profile) | **off** — the bot joins anonymously |

Two consequences follow, and they are the honest form of the activation notice:

1. **Every ZAKI capture is started by hand.** There is no scheduled or calendar-triggered capture in
   ZAKI production. Documentation in this repository that describes calendar sync and auto-join
   describes *this engine's* features, correctly; it does not describe ZAKI's deployment.
2. **Every ZAKI capture needs a human to admit the bot.** Because authenticated-bot mode is off, the
   notetaker joins Google Meet as an anonymous external participant, and Google Meet requires a host
   to admit those. Measured over all captures recorded in both ZAKI environments to date, roughly
   **28–29% failed**, and 8 of the 10 surviving failures failed for exactly this reason: the bot
   reached the waiting room with nobody there to let it in. The notetaker's display name is
   `ZAKI Notetaker`; admitting it is a required step, not an optional one.

Recording the failure rate here because it is a property of the activation state, not a transient
bug: with anonymous join as the only enabled mode, a capture nobody admits cannot succeed, and that
is a choice this deployment has made rather than a defect it has hit.

The `v0.12.2` tag contains the first post-`v0.12.1` delivery batch, including an edge guard, fresh
install fixes, Jitsi support, and release-pipeline work. Unlike
[the documented `v0.12.1` release](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/releases/tag/v0.12.1), the
[`v0.12.2` tag](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/releases/tag/v0.12.2) did not yet have a full GitHub
release-note/assets bundle when this fork was created on 2026-07-13. We therefore treat it as a
source baseline to verify ourselves, not as production-readiness evidence.

## Why Vexa remains the base

Primary-source review on 2026-07-13 found Vexa to be the best fit for ZAKI's constraints:

| Option | Fit | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| [Vexa](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa) | Apache-2.0; self-hosted; Meet, Teams, Zoom, and now Jitsi; speaker-attributed transcription; per-meeting workers; Compose and Helm; own Postgres/Redis/object storage; API compatibility harness | Selected. It matches ZAKI's Kubernetes, data-control, and forkability requirements. |
| [Attendee](https://github.com/attendee-labs/attendee) | Mature bot API and active releases; simpler Django deployment | Rejected as a fork base because its [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/attendee-labs/attendee/blob/main/LICENSE) prohibits providing a substantial set of its functionality as a hosted or managed service. |
| [MeetingBot](https://github.com/meetingbot/meetingbot) | Open source and multi-platform | Rejected: AWS/Terraform-centric deployment and LGPL obligations are a weaker fit than Vexa's Apache-2.0 Kubernetes path. |
| Hosted bot APIs | Fastest operational start | Rejected as the engine foundation: they are not forkable and move the raw meeting data plane outside ZAKI's control. A hosted Vexa-compatible endpoint may still be used for a synthetic Package 1 adapter test. |
| Build the bot fleet from scratch | Maximum control | Rejected: browser admission, media capture, per-platform churn, teardown, and transcription operations are the expensive part Vexa already provides. |

Relevant upstream evidence:

- Vexa describes a self-hosted Apache-2.0 bot and transcription API for Meet, Teams, and Zoom, with
  the transcription API usable independently from its agent lane:
  <https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa>
- Vexa documents Lite, Compose, and production Kubernetes/Helm deployment paths:
  <https://docs.vexa.ai/deployment>
- `v0.12.1` records published-image validation for Lite, Compose, bot spawn, Kubernetes/Helm, and
  the `0.10` compatibility suite:
  <https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/releases/tag/v0.12.1>
- Attendee's current license text contains the hosted-service restriction:
  <https://github.com/attendee-labs/attendee/blob/main/LICENSE>

## ZAKI product boundary

Vexa supplies meeting mechanics. ZAKI supplies product policy. The fork must preserve these
boundaries:

1. The Minutes store owns meeting metadata, audio, transcripts, and spoke summaries.
2. The ZAKI agent is the only writer of the brain. The Minutes engine never receives brain
   credentials and never writes durable brain state.
3. Agent access is read-only through the versioned ZAKI cross-spoke contract, protected by a
   dedicated Minutes read token and path/header/item tenant agreement.
4. Transcript content is untrusted data, not instructions. It is bounded, non-cacheable, and never
   written verbatim to brain memory, traces, logs, or workspace artifacts.
5. Visible bot identity, tenant capture attestation, agent-read opt-in, TTL enforcement, deletion,
   erasure receipts, and backup expiry are activation prerequisites.
6. Hub provisioning, wallet metering, webhook idempotency, and user-facing state remain hub-owned.
7. Every feature is default-off until its contract, isolation, erasure, and live-meeting gates pass.

The sealed `/api/zaki/read/v1` Minutes profile lives at
[`core/meetings/contracts/zaki-read.v1`](core/meetings/contracts/zaki-read.v1/README.md). Role 8
approved its WP-15 envelope, expiry, provenance and byte-bound decisions. Meeting-api now implements
the default-off, token-protected runtime route; deployment credentials, Hub activation and the
witnessed launch gate remain separate work.

## Downstream discipline

- `upstream/main` remains the source remote; `origin` is ProjectNuggets.
- ZAKI changes land as small commits on `codex/*` branches and preserve upstream module boundaries.
- Upstream updates are reviewed tag-by-tag. Never merge a moving branch directly into a deployable
  ZAKI release.
- For an update, record old/new tags and SHAs, inspect release evidence and license changes, merge or
  rebase in an isolated worktree, then run `node scripts/gates.mjs all` plus ZAKI contract tests.
- Published images will use immutable ZAKI tags and digests. Upstream `latest` is never deployable.
- Upstream security advisories and dependency/license gates are reviewed before promotion.

## Staging image publication

The manual [`zaki-minutes-images`](.github/workflows/zaki-minutes-images.yml) workflow publishes
only the four Minutes deployment images to GitHub Container Registry:

- `ghcr.io/projectnuggets/zaki-minutes-admin-api`
- `ghcr.io/projectnuggets/zaki-minutes-meeting-api`
- `ghcr.io/projectnuggets/zaki-minutes-runtime`
- `ghcr.io/projectnuggets/zaki-minutes-bot`

Each image is built from the selected source revision and receives exactly one source tag,
`sha-<full-source-sha>`. The workflow resolves each pushed digest and uploads
`zaki-minutes-images.json`, whose `repository`, `tag`, and `digest` fields are the reviewed values
for a chart release. It does not publish `latest`, change a chart, or activate an environment. The
bot's `vexa/meet-join-env:dev` base is built locally from this fork during the workflow; it is not
pulled as a public Vexa bot image.

## Kubernetes bot Pod contract

For a ZAKI Kubernetes deployment, the runtime accepts `ZAKI_MINUTES_BOT_CONTRACT_JSON` only for
the `meeting-bot` profile. The contract pins the ProjectNuggets GHCR bot image by source SHA and
digest and carries the restricted Pod settings: non-root UID/GID, RuntimeDefault seccomp, dropped
Linux capabilities, read-only root filesystem, dedicated service account with token mounting off,
bounded resources, and the `/tmp` and `/dev/shm` writable volumes. A supplied contract is validated
at boot; a malformed or broadened document prevents the runtime from starting rather than creating
a less restricted browser Pod. `BROWSER_IMAGE` remains the upstream-compatible path outside this
ZAKI package.
